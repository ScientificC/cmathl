# Introduction

The C Math Library _(CML)_ is a collection of routines for
numerical computing.  The routines have been written from scratch in C,
and present a modern Applications Programming Interface
(API) for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be written for very
high level languages.  The source code is distributed under the MIT License.

In summary, CML is a pure mathematical C library with a wide variety of
mathematical functions that seeks to be close to complying with
ANSI C for portability.  It is free software under the MIT License.

## Routines available in CML

The library covers a wide range of topics in numerical computing.
Routines are available for the following areas,

* Mathematical Functions
* Complex Numbers
* Special Functions
* Quaternions
* Differential Equations
* Numerical Differentiation
* IEEE Floating-Point
* Physical Constants
* Easing Functions
* Statistics
* Blocks
* Vector _(Valarrays)_ and Matrices
* Sorting Methods
* One Dimensional Root-Finding

CML is thread-safe and suitable for use in a parallel environment.

# Download and Installation

To download the library, simply clone, fork or download a zip of the [Github repo](https://github.com/CMATHL/cml).  
Alternatively, releases are available [here](https://github.com/CMATHL/cml/releases). 
The users of Visual Studio can directly use binary releases.

For more details on installing and using the library, see the README file on the [Github page](https://github.com/CMATHL/cml).

# Documentation

CML comes with a manual describing all the routines exported by the
library. This documentation written using _sphinx_ can be produced in both PDF or
HTML formats.

# About the library

The CML project started in 2016/2017 and has been mainly developed by Ulises Jeremias Cornejo Fandos since then with some contributions by Lucas Di Cunzolo.
