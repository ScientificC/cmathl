    CML Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains functions for sorting data, both directly and
indirectly (using an index).

All the functions use the heapsort algorithm.
============================================

Heapsort is an O(N log(N)) algorithm which operates in-place and does not
require any additional storage. It also provides consistent performance,
the running time for its worst-case (ordered data) being not significantly
longer than the average and best cases.

NOTE: the heapsort algorithm does not preserve the relative ordering
of equal elements—it is an unstable sort. However the resulting order
of equal elements will be consistent across different platforms
when using these functions.


Why not having an additional algorithm?
=======================================

CML provides a slightly more complete alternative to the standard library
function qsort(). This qsort routine was taken from Bentley & McIlroy's
"Engineering a Sort Function" and modified by Ulises Jeremias Cornejo Fandos
to store the permutation vector resulting from the sorting and to
sort array with non contiguous cells, typically a column of matrix
sorted row-wise.
